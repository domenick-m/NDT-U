    "Why use wandb?\n",
    "- All in one package for logging and running hyperparameter sweeps\n",
    "    - Show example of adding wandb to simple training workflow / creating HP sweep\n",
    "- Can help keep runs organized across machines (most people will not need this because they use manifold)\n",
    "- Easy visualization\n",
    "    - show the embeded html\n",
    "\n",
    "Downsides to wandb\n",
    "- Show my script for starting multiple runs at once \n",
    "    - Maybe show evidence for why not to run multiple models on 1 GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "My workflow\n",
    "- Show HP options confirmation page / how to edit those\n",
    "- Show training tqdm \n",
    "- Show how sweeps can be started\n",
    "- Explain that pytorch lightning does all this / maybe why this is better\n",
    "- Show visualization tools\n",
    "- Go over plotly\n",
    "- Go over how to upload to notion (this will require its own repo)\n",
    "- Go over nvitop\n",

    "NEED TO DO:\n",
    "1. Create example basic training workflow (look for wandb examples) and turn into a sweep\n",
    "2. Create example repo with a minimal NDT in it. Needs to have:\n",
    "    - tmux sweep\n",
    "    - confirmation page\n",
    "    - tqdm bar\n",
    "    - eval script (finish up all plots)\n",
    "    - needs to save plots to project folder for easy access on notion\n",
    "3. Test if multiple runs on 1 gpu is faster\n"
